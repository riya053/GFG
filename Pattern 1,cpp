Geek is very fond of patterns. Once, his teacher gave him a square pattern to solve. He gave Geek an integer n and asked him to build a pattern.

Help Geek to build a star pattern.

 

Example 1:

Input: 5

Output:
* * * * *
* * * * *
* * * * *
* * * * *
* * * * *

solution:

void printSquare(int n) {
        // code here
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
        {
            for(int j=0;j<n;j++)
            {
                cout<<"*"<<" ";
            }
            cout<<endl;
        }
    }
